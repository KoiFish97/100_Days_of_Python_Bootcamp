# Rounding
# print(round(8 / 3)) = 3

# Specify the number of digit precision
# In this case, 2 decimal places
# print(round(8 / 3, 2)) = 2.67

# Floor Division
# Works like int conversion chopping off all decimal values
# Puts out an integer as opposed to float like most division
# print(8 // 3) = 2

# Saving Results
# Can then further do math on the variable
# result = 4 / 2
# result /= 2
# print(result)
# 4 / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1

# Score example
# score = 0
# score = score + 1 (Not preferred)
# score += 1 (Changes score to 1)
# print(score)

# F Strings
# score = 0
# print("your score is " + score)
# ^^^ Creates an error due to different data types

# F Strings convert variables for you
# score = 0
# height = 1.8
# isWinning = True
# print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}")

# Day 2 - Life in Weeks
# My Solution (Matched Challenge Solution)
# age = input()
# yearsLeft = 90 - int(age)
# weeksLeft = yearsLeft * 52
# print(f"You have {weeksLeft} weeks left.")
